            <p>Laboratory for Urban Boundaries was founded by Anne Marie Aure, Paolo Ricci, and Thibault Felix to challenge and reconfigure the frameworks of urban development. We are a collective of architects and researchers who support grassroots movements for ecological and social justice through spatial interventions and participatory design strategies.</p>

            <p>Our methodology emphasizes long-term relationship building and knowledge co-production with local residents. We focus on building bridges between communities and institutional planning bodies.</p>

            <p>Our primary work has been concentrated in Norway, where we have sustained a movement for the protection of ravines north of Oslo through public engagement, spatial documentation, and alternative planning proposals. This project serves as a testing ground for methodologies that can be applied to environmental protection campaigns in other contexts. We engage in fieldwork, writing, and research activities across multiple scales and contexts, working directly with residents and local groups.</p>

            <p>We are actively seeking for partnerships with organizations, communities, and researchers working on spatial justice and environmental protection. Please <a href="contact.html">contact us</a> if you have ideas for collaboration.</p>
